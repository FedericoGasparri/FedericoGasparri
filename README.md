## Hi there

My name is Federico Gasparri. I am an Italian student currently graduating with an MSc in Financial Risk and Data Analysis at Sapienza University of Rome.

I have a strong interest in Machine Learning, with a particular focus on applications in trading and risk management. I am using this space to share both academic and personal projects that reflect my journey and growth in these fields.

Feel free to explore the repositories below to learn more about my work.
